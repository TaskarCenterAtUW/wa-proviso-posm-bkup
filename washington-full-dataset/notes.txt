osmium tags-filter washington_full.pbf w/highway  -o ways.osm.pbf
osmium export ways.osm.pbf -o washington_full.edges.geojson


cat your_geojson_file.geojson | jq '.features[] | select(.geometry.type == "Point")'

cat washington_ways.geojson | jq '{ type: "FeatureCollection", features: [.features[] | select(.geometry.type == "Point")] }' > nodes.geojson

cat washington_ways.geojson | jq '{ type: "FeatureCollection", features: [.features[] | select(.geometry.type == "LineString")] }' > ways.geojson

So the edges file seems to be around 920MB. This will be an issue 
Trying to get multiple extracts from single .pbf file using configuration file

- Extract all the county pbf files from washington_full.pbf using config option
- Config file is there in counties-config.json file
- Once the PBF is got, use OSM-OSW converter library to generate the datasets
- Once the datasets are prepared, use script to upload the new datasets to TDEI.
